    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cashew brittle is one of my biggest requests at Christmas. Through the years, I have always made peanut brittle, but when my hubby could no longer have peanuts, I replaced them with cashews.
         It makes a nice thank-you gift and is always a hit at bake sales!</p>
    <p>This gift-worthy cashew brittle is sweet, crunchy, and absolutely irresistible.</p>
